{- Next comes the heart of the editor. You get a keystroke and the current buffer,

{- The editor window gives you a resizable rectangular viewport onto the editor buffer.
   You get told
     the current size of the viewport
     which row and col of the buffer are at the top left of the viewport
       (so you can handle documents which are taller or wider than the window)
     the most recent change report and buffer

   You need to figure out whether you need to move the viewport
       (by finding out if the cursor is still within the viewport)
     and if so, where to.

   You need to figure out what to redisplay. If the change report says
     lineEdit and the viewport has not moved, you need only repaint the
     current line. If the viewport has moved or the change report says
     bigChange, you need to repaint the whole buffer.

   You will need to be able to grab a rectangular region of text from the
     buffer, but you do know how big and where from.

   Remember to put the cursor in the right place, relative to where in
     the buffer the viewport is supposed to be. The goRowCol action takes
     *viewport* coordinates, not *buffer* coordinates! You will need to
     invent subtraction!
-}
{- Your code does not need to worry about resizing the window. My code does
   that. On detecting a size change, my code just calls your code with a
   bigChange report and the same buffer, so if you are doing a proper repaint,
   the right thing will happen. -}
{- 4 marks for ensuring that a buffer smaller than the viewport displays
       correctly, with the cursor in the right place, if nobody changes
       the viewport size
   3 marks for ensuring that the cursor remains within the viewport even if
       the viewport needs to move
   3 marks for ensuring that lineEdit changes need only affect one line of
       the display (provided the cursor stays in the viewport)
-}

{- For the last 8 marks, you have a chance to be even more creative. You have
   spare detectable keys that you could invent meanings for. You also have the
   freedom to change the definition of Buffer, as my code does not care what
   a Buffer is: it only needs to know how to initialize, update and render,
   and these are defined by you.

   Additional structural cursor moves (beginning and end of line, etc) will not
   score much. Going left or right word-by-word would score more: you can
   match against a pattern such as ' '.

   Selection and cut/copy/paste are worth the big bucks. For these, you need to
   modify the Buffer structure to remember the clipboard contents (if any),
   and to manage the extent of any selected region.

   If you feel the need to vary the foreground or background colour of the displayed
   text (e.g. to show a selection), please let me know.

   To quit the editor, do
     ctrl-C
   like an old-fashioned soul.

{- There is no one right way to do this exercise, and there is some scope for
   extension. It's important that you get in touch if you need help, either in
   achieving the basic deliverable, or in finding ways to explore beyond it.
